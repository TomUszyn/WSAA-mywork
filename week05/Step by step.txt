Andrew had always dreamed big. He wanted to run a marathon, learn to play the piano and start his own business. But every time he thought about these goals, they felt overwhelming. He would start strong, then quickly lose motivation, feeling like success was too far away. One day, while walking through the park, he noticed an elderly man planting a tiny tree. Curious, Andrew asked, "Sir, do you really think you'll live long enough to see this tree grow?" The man smiled and replied, "Maybe not, but I’m not planting it for myself. Every great thing starts small. The secret is to keep going, one step at a time." Inspired, Andrew decided to apply the same wisdom to his own life. Instead of trying to achieve everything at once, he focused on small, daily steps. He ran just a little each morning, practised the piano for ten minutes a day, and worked on his business idea for an hour each evening. Weeks turned into months, and before he knew it, Andrew had finished his first 5K, played a full song on the piano, and launched a small but promising business. He realized that success wasn’t about rushing to the finish line—it was about consistency and belief in the journey. And so, whenever he faced a challenge, Andrew would smile and remind himself: Every great thing starts small.
